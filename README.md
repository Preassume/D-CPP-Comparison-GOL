# D-CPP-Comparison-GOL
I tried to make nearly identical Game of Life implementations in both D and C++ for a fun little comparison.


The buttons and stuff are a little different since I basically just grabbed those files from other projects, but they are still very similar.  The rest is meant to be a fun little syntax comparison between two of my favorite programming languages.
